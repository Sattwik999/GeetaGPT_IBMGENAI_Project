Hrsikesa Means the owner of the senses. The Lord situated in the hearts of all living entities, direct their senses. But He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity, and in case of pure devotee He directly controls the senses. In the battleﬁeld He directly controls the transcendental senses of Arjuna. Therefore, Krsna’s name is Hrsikesa who gave direction to Arjuna on the battleﬁeld of Kuruksetra. Acyuta Krsna although is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, never fails in His aﬀection for His devotees, and thus he is called as Acyuta. As a charioteer, He had to carry out the orders of Arjuna, but still He did not hesitate to do so. And His Supreme position was not challenged by doing so. In all circumstances He remains the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Govinda Means who give pleasures to cows and the senses. By using this signiﬁcant word, Arjuna in- dicates that Krsna should understand what will satisfy Arjuna’s senses. But Govinda is not meant for satisfying our senses. If we try to satisfy the senses of Govinda, however, then automatically our own senses are satisﬁed. Madhusudana Lord Krsna killed the demon Madhu, and Arjuna wanted Krsna to kill the demon of misunderstanding that had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty. Demon Madhu represent the misunderstanding or doubt in the heart of the devotees. And Krsna killed the demon Madhu, therefore, He’s called as Madhusudana. 4"}

Fruitive activities are the engagements of one’s reactions from past good or bad deeds. When one is awake in Krsna consciousness, he need no longer endeavor for good results in his activities. When one is situated in Krsna consciousness, all activities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to dualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of Krsna consciousness is renunciation of the material conception of life. This state is automatically achieved by progressive Krsna consciousness."}

Fear of spiritual personal identity When people in such a bodily conception are informed of personal form of the Lord, they reject it and accept gigantic material manifestation as supreme, generally understood as impersonal.

The Lord who pervades everywhere, is eternal, and does not experience destruction of the body (as His body is transcendental), and is full of auspicious attributes and is devoid of any blemishes. He is superior to individual souls and hence is worthy of worship. One should perform ones prescribed duties as an offering to the Lord without expectations. This paves the way for one’s liberation. Coming to the practical aspects of Arjuna’s decision to relinquish arms, the Lord emphasizes the need for Arjuna to perform his prescribed duties, as for a kshatriya, there is no loftier duty than waging a just war. Arjuna has been handed a great opportunity to perform his duty and he should not waste this chance. If he were to withdraw from war, purely out of compassion to near and dear ones, nothing would prevent his enemies from concluding that Arjuna was afraid to fight, and they could question his valor. Finally, Krishna tells Arjuna that he has nothing to lose by waging the war. If he wins, he gets to rule the kingdom and eventually goes to heaven hereafter for diligently performing his duty. If he loses and dies, he will attain heavens for his conviction and efforts (2.31-2.37). From verses 2.12 to 2.38, Krishna imparts Arjuna knowledge (sankhya) about the Lord and individual souls. From verse 2.39 onwards, He teaches Arjuna the methods and procedure (yoga) for acquiring such knowledge after which Arjuna would be able to perform his prescribed duties with conviction, realize the Lord, get over worldly bondage and achieve the state of eternal bliss (moksha).

The reason for its supremacy is its ability to bring to fruition the prescribed duties performed by a seeker. After all, one cannot perform any activity, if one does not have the knowledge of the need for such an action, or the method of performance of such action etc. One cannot conclude that only acquiring such knowledge is good enough.

In verse 4.13, the Lord discusses the creation of living beings based on one’s innate nature, aptitude, and activities. In verse 4.14, the Lord states that He has no obligations and activities do not bind Him. He states that one who clearly understands the distinction between the supreme soul and individual souls will not be entangled by actions. Categories and nature of activities are described in verses 4.16-33 which provide comparison of nishkama karma to other types of activities (karma), and details of the types of nishkama karma. Verses 4.16 to 4.18, compare the different types of activities – karma (right action), vikarma (prohibited action), and akarma (inaction). Verse 4.18 describes the two attributes of one who is performing one’s duty perfectly– (i) such a person realizes that even when performing prescribed duties, the actual work is being enabled by the Lord  himself  and (ii)  when not actively performing duties, (ex: during sleep, dream) activity such as breathing is enabled by the Lord. Such a wise person will derive full benefits from duties performed. In that sense verse 4.18 is a summary of this entire chapter. Five verses (4.19- 23) describe the characteristics of such a wise person, which briefly are – pandit (highly knowledgeable), ever contented, detached, equanimous. That person would also have deep conviction in divine, spiritual knowledge. Verses 4.24-30 contain a discussion on different types of sacrifices performed by seekers in their quest for self-realization and liberation. These verses emphatically state that Vedic sacrifice (yagna) not only refers to the symbolic acts of propitiating deities with fire rituals etc., but also refers to other selfless acts such as donating to charity, devotional worship to the Lord Almighty, spiritual education, self-control, self-discipline etc. The discussion on sacrifices is concluded in verse 4.32 where the Lord exhorts Arjuna to fight the just war to protect his citizens as that is his prescribed duty.

This description is enigmatic, and one can appreciate the explanation provided by Sri Rayaru in GV to help understand the real meaning of these verses. The correspondence between the components of the tree and the entities in the universe are as follows: Earth (supporting the tree) = The Lord Almighty; Roots = Sentient and inert nature; New roots = The three qualities of nature; Branches = The five basic elements of nature; Sub-branches = Physical bodies of living beings; Leaves = The Vedas; Flowers, Fruit = Worldly desires, Liberation. Using the analogy of a banyan tree, these two verses appear to illustrate the concepts of gradations among various deities described previously in 3.42. Verses 15.3 – 15.5 describe the manner in which a seeker needs to approach the concepts in the Tree of the Universe to understand the nature of the Lord.

Verse 18.11 counters a position that some hold that a renouncer should forsake all activities. This verse states that for a living being, it is impossible to forsake all activities, as even breathing is a type of activity. An ideal renouncer is one who forsakes the rewards from actions and not actions themselves. Verse 18.12 explains the distinction between a seeker who performs activities with expectations of   rewards and one who performs prescribed duties with no expectations. The former one experiences three different types of destinations in afterlife: downfall, heavenly rewards, and rebirth in this world (depending on the approach and nature of their activities such as tamasic, sattvic, rajasic). However, one who performs prescribed duties forsaking rewards will not experience these types of destinations. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that those seekers who have"}

This statement can raise issues as to how one can be absolved of great sins that normally accompany such destructive activities. Sri Rayaru in GV based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GB and Sri Jaya Teertha’s PD clarifies this concept with concrete examples. Lord Rudra (who governs the act of universe’s dissolution) and Lord Yama (the deity of death) are associated with destruction. However, these deities perform these activities as directed by the independent, omniscient Lord Almighty and have no delusion that they are performing these on their own. Hence, they are not tainted by any sin. However, deity Indra who kills Vrutasura, was tainted with some sin as his actions were accompanied by ego."}
